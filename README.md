# MLRan: A Behavioural Dataset for Ransomware Analysis and Detection

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2505.18613-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18613)

**MLRan** is a large-scale, high-quality behavioural dataset designed to support research in machine learning-based ransomware detection, classification, and behavioural analysis. The dataset comprises **over 4,800 dynamically analysed samples**, spanning **64 ransomware families** and a **balanced set of goodware**, collected between **2006 and 2024**. The dataset covers all major types of ransomware, including locker, crypto, ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), and modern types.

MLRan is developed in line with **GUIDE-MLRan**, a set of practical guidelines we propose for constructing high-quality behavioural ransomware datasets. The repository provides open access to the dataset (feature-processed), collection and parsing scripts, machine learning pipelines, and interpretability experiments, all designed to ensure reproducibility and transparency.

## Disclaimer

All ransomware analyses were conducted in **controlled sandbox environments**. This repository **does not distribute raw binaries**. However, we provide the hashes of the samples and complete metadata, including code to help in downloading the samples. Researchers are advised to follow appropriate safety protocols when working with malware and to comply with their institutionâ€™s ethical and legal standards.
