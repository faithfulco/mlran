# Cuckoo JSON Report Parsers

This repository contains a modular set of Python scripts for extracting behavioural features from dynamic analysis reports (`report.json` files) generated by [Cuckoo Sandbox](https://cuckoosandbox.org/). The extracted features are intended for use in machine learning pipelines focused on malware and ransomware detection.

## Usage

1. Place your `report.json` files in the `json_reports/` directory.
2. Run individual parsers or use the `combined_parser.ipynb` notebook for batch processing.
3. Outputs can be stored as structured features for further analysis or machine learning tasks.
